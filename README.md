# CodeTalk
Code Talk is a step to make programming IDEs more accessible. The plugin currently concentrates on three main aspects of Programming:
1. Glanceability
2. Real-Time Error information 
3. Accessible Debugging

CodeTalk is currently only available for Visual Studio running in windows. We are working very hard towards bringing it to more platforms and IDEs. Stay tuned.
